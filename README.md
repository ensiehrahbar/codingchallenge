There is a publicly available API for the webcomic XKCD â€“ [https://xkcd.com/json.html](https://xkcd.com/json.html)

And an RSS feed for PDL: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoorlyDrawnLines](http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoorlyDrawnLines)

## Description
Create a RESTful service that pulls last 10 strips from each and combines them in a single json feed (20 recent entries in total). The response should contain the following data for each entry:

- picture url
- title / description
- web url for browser view
- publishing date

Sort the resulting feed by publishing date from recent to older.
